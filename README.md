# 🕸️ Web Scraping with Python: Extracting World Population Data

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases how to use Python to collect and organize data from the web. Specifically, it extracts tabular data from the Wikipedia page on world population using `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`. The goal is to automate data extraction from a structured HTML table and convert it into a clean DataFrame.

## 🚀 Features
- Sends HTTP requests to retrieve webpage content
- Parses HTML documents using BeautifulSoup
- Finds and extracts table data from Wikipedia
- Organizes content using pandas DataFrame
- Optional export of data to CSV for storage or analysis

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- requests
- beautifulsoup4
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Data Source
The webpage used in this example is publicly available:  
🔗 [Wikipedia – World Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population)
